# Henry Tan

Henry, member of FREAK Lab Thailand, metaPhorest Japan, and 2024 resident artist at CGSB, NYUAD, Henry explores the boundaries between life and simulation. He investigates how emerging technologies like synthetic biology, mixed reality, brain stimulation, and artificial intelligence blur the lines between the real and the simulated. His work delves into how life adapts and negotiates with a constantly changing environment, shaped by factors like climate change, geopolitics, and geoeconomics. Henry uses sleep as a prism to understand and investigate life, society, culture, and technology. He creates installations, performances, songs, and architecture for people to rest and reimagine their perceptions through sleep and dreams.
